# CURRENT_TASK.md

## Active task

**Wizmatch results-first sourcing — SearchAPI.io, TheirStack, ATS and named-POC provider release is
staging-qualified. Deploy the exact reviewed commits and activate the two-user production pilot.**

Work only in `/Users/jatinagrawal/repo-comparison/v2-wizmatch-phase0-trust` on
`codex/wizmatch-phase0-trust`. Preserve the unrelated dirty workspace at
`/Users/jatinagrawal/repo-comparison/v2`.

## Verified release candidate

- `c293b88` adds SearchAPI.io public research, shared POC/X-Ray allowance, provider-account status,
  real free TheirStack preview, hiring-team evidence, requirement-specific X-Ray queries and honest
  provider UI.
- `142eb51` handles free-credit account reporting, excludes up to 500 seen TheirStack job IDs before
  paid retrieval, and retries one transient SearchAPI timeout/429/5xx response.
- No schema or migration changed. No credential value entered Git, docs, `.ai`, screenshots or
  command output.
- Final local suite: TypeScript build; 47 files / 395 Vitest tests; admin production build; 22/22
  Wizmatch Playwright scenarios; `git diff --check` clean.

## Isolated staging evidence

- Deployment `d3b0e543-87db-4fe3-87e2-703bebcbc350` is `SUCCESS`; health/database are green.
- Supplied temporary credentials validate: TheirStack reports 200 credits; SearchAPI.io reports
  100 starting free credits. Values remain secret.
- TheirStack imported 29 public India target-role signals across two capped runs: all 29 have
  distinct provider IDs and matching SAP/Java/JavaScript/frontend title evidence. One provider
  repeat updated the existing row rather than creating a duplicate; the release now excludes seen
  IDs before retrieval.
- ATS refreshed 10 controlled Greenhouse jobs with no new duplicates or errors.
- POC research produced six named public candidates and correctly left them
  `identified_channel_pending`; no email/phone was guessed.
- Requirement-first X-Ray produced 10 requirement-linked leads. All 10 remain unreviewed and cannot
  enter canonical matching until a recruiter validates evidence.
- Authenticated live Signals UI passed desktop, tablet and 390px mobile with all provider cards,
  shared allowance, no horizontal overflow, no console errors and no 5xx responses.
- Legacy Wizmatch automation, sending, paid discovery and Google fallback remain off. No outreach,
  consent, submission or production business record was created.

## Exact next action

1. Verify production health and branch freshness.
2. Push the exact reviewed branch to `main` and wait for Railway terminal `SUCCESS` with new source
   flags still off.
3. Inject the validated TheirStack/SearchAPI secrets directly into production Railway secrets.
4. Enable source master + TheirStack + ATS + POC for Jatin/Kanishk; leave X-Ray off until a genuine
   accepted, skill-reviewed requirement exists.
5. Run one capped genuine TheirStack cycle, verify run audit/deduplication, then activate manual
   requirement-first X-Ray only for a genuine requirement.

Never add users, enable pilot-all, sending, paid discovery, Google fallback, legacy automation,
automatic requirements, outreach, consent, shortlist or submission. Never delete production data.
